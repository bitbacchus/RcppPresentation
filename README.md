## What is the content of this talk? 

R is one of the most popular programming languages in science, and well suited for all data and stats centered tasks. In my field, Ecology, R is *lingua franca*. For reproducible science and re-usability of code in Ecology, you should ideally share your work in R.

R is fast for most day-to-day statistics-centered scripting tasks, but it is rather slow for general-purpose programming. Therefore, R developers use C/C++ or Fortran libraries to speed up computation-heavy parts of their packages. Writing and linking such libraries was relatively cumbersome until Rcpp was available.

Rcpp integrates C++ code seamlessly into R. It is both, an R package and a C++ library. It compiles C++ from within R and "automagically" links the library to R's API.

### Preliminary schedule
- (My) Motivation to use R + Rcpp
- How and why Rcpp works
- Demo
    - Rcpp intro in RStudio
    - How to use RInsde to develop Rcpp code in C++ IDEs (here: Qt Creator)
